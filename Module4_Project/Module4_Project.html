        <h1>Module 4 Project 1</h1>
    <p class="leftside">Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, 
        space, and the universe as a whole. It explores the origins,
         evolution, and structure of stars, planets, galaxies, and 
         other cosmic phenomena. By observing the night sky and utilizing 
         advanced technology like telescopes and satellites, astronomers 
         have been able to uncover important information about the universe's 
         age, its expansion, and the various forces that govern the movement 
         of celestial bodies. From understanding the life cycles of stars to 
         identifying exoplanets that could potentially support life, astronomy
         has provided profound insights into the workings of the cosmos.
    </p>
    <p class="rightside">In addition to its scientific value, astronomy also plays a crucial role 
        in shaping human curiosity and our understanding of existence. It has 
        inspired civilizations throughout history, influencing calendars, navigation,
        and cultural myths. Modern astronomy, supported by space exploration, continues
        to push the boundaries of what we know, driving technological advancements and
        deepening our understanding of the universe's vastness. Whether studying black
        holes or the mysterious dark matter, astronomy connects us to the grand scale
        of the cosmos, reminding us of our place within it.
