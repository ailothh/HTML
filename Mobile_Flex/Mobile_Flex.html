          <p>Space is a vast, mysterious expanse that extends beyond our planet, 
            filled with wonders like stars, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena. It is
            so large that scientists often use light-years, the distance light 
            travels in a year, to measure distances between celestial objects. 
            Despite space being mostly empty, it contains a variety of fascinating 
            objects and phenomena that continue to intrigue astronomers and space
            enthusiasts alike.</p>

            <p>Stars are one of the most common celestial objects in space, each 
                being a giant ball of hot, glowing gas. Our Sun is just one of 
                billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Galaxies, like the 
                Milky Way, contain billions of stars and come in different shapes,
                such as spiral, elliptical, and irregular. The Andromeda Galaxy, 
                which is about 2.5 million light-years away from us, is the closest
                spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and is on a slow collision course with 
                our own galaxy, which will take billions of years to occur.

            <p>One of the most enigmatic objects in space is the black hole, a region of
                space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. Black 
                holes are often formed from the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed.
                Scientists also study dark matter, a mysterious substance that makes up about
                27% of the universe's mass. Dark matter cannot be seen directly but is believed
                to play a crucial role in holding galaxies together due to its gravitational effects.
